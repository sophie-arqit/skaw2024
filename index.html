In this workshop, we aim to shine light on the secure alternative of Symmetric Key Agreement (SKA). There is growing evidence for real-world use cases of SKA by various IETF standards, NIST guidelines, and NSA requirements, including the use of Symmetric Pre-Shared Keys for enhanced quantum-resistant protection. The goal of the SKA Workshop is to examine how symmetric keys can reduce reliance on asymmetric cryptography by providing alternative and/or additional layers of security.  We aim to gather academic and industrial experts to discuss the solutions that SKA can offer. ",

                   We present a crypto-agile protocol for quantum-secure end-to-end (E2E) encryption key establishment with extremely strong security properties. It is based on a concept that we call multimodal cryptography, which combines various forms of computational cryptography (symmetric-key, asymmetric-key, and post-quantum). If available, quantum key distribution (QKD) can be seamlessly integrated to further fortify the key establishment process. Alternatively, if the availability of QKD is taken as a given, one can consider multimodal cryptography a solution to quantum communication’s last-mile problem.

                <div class="abstract">End-to-end authenticity in public networks plays a significant role. Namely, without
                    authenticity, the adversary might be able to retrieve even confidential information straight away by
                    impersonating others. Proposed solutions to establish an authenticated channel cover pre-shared keybased, 
                    password-based, and certificate-based techniques. To add confidentiality to an authenticated channel, authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols usually have one of the three solutions built in. As an amplification, hybrid AKE (HAKE) approaches are getting more popular nowadays and were presented in several flavors to incorporate  classical, post-quantum, or quantum-key-distribution components. The main benefit is redundancy, i.e., if some of the components fail, the primitive still yields a confidential and authenticated channel. 
                    <br>
                    At PQCrypto20, Dowling, Brandt, Hansen, and Paterson introduced a new modular framework for designing HAKE and presented a first instantiation, dubbed Muckle, requires pre-shared keys (and hence yields inefficient end-to-end authenticity). Recently (at PQCrypto23), Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed  a new extended instantiation called Muckle+, that utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. In this talk, we will present Muckle++ that extends previous works by using post-quantum KEM for authentication. While replacing pre-shared keys with public-key authenticators is rather straightforward, the challenge is to derive the proof in the HAKE framework. As emphasised in KEMTLS, the main motivation is that pq KEM turn to be more efficient than pq signature schemes.
