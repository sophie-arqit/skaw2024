      "description": "In the past few decades, asymmetric cryptography has been the rising star of key agreement protocols. In this workshop, we aim to shine light on the secure alternative of Symmetric Key Agreement (SKA). There is growing evidence for real-world use cases of SKA by various IETF standards, NIST guidelines, and NSA requirements, including the use of Symmetric Pre-Shared Keys for enhanced quantum-resistant protection. The goal of the SKA Workshop is to examine how symmetric keys can reduce reliance on asymmetric cryptography by providing alternative and/or additional layers of security.  We aim to gather academic and industrial experts to discuss the solutions that SKA can offer. ",

        <h2>Call for Proposals</h2>
        <!-- Add call for proposals here -->
        <p>We are seeking speakers giving talks on themes related to Symmetric Key Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to: protocols, cryptanalysis, applications, challenges for SKA and relevance to industry. We are seeking a mix of academia, public sector and private sector speakers and audience. </p>
        <p>Please submit talk proposals by midnight AOE June 2, 2024 to *****. Talks will be 25 minutes long. Proposals should include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstract</li>
            <li>Your affliation</li>
            <li>Paper pdf if applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that accepted talks will not appear in the Crypto2024 Proceedings. Thus we are happy to accept talks that are submitted elsewhere, including talks on already published topics.</p>
